# Car-Price-Prediction-Model ðŸš—
This project leverages multiple machine learning models to accurately predict a vehicle's selling price based on various attributes like mileage, brand, model, year, engine size, and fuel type.

The project evaluates **XGBoost**, **Multiple Linear Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**, comparing performance primarily via **RMSE**.

## 1) Project Overview

Models

### Key Objectives
- Prepared and explored a Kaggle-derived car dataset.
- Trained and evaluated Linear Regression, KNN, and MLP models.
- Compared models using RMSE and picked the most reliable approach.
- Translated results into practical, business-style recommendations.

---

## 2) Data### Data Splitting for Modeling
For modeling purposes, the dataset was separated into:
- **Full dataset** (`cardata.csv`) â€” used for exploratory data analysis and initial model trials.
- **Training set** (`cardata_Train.csv`) â€” used to fit models (e.g., KNN, MLP) in WEKA.
- **Test set** (`cardata_Test.csv`) â€” used to evaluate the final performance of models after training.

The split ensured that performance metrics like RMSE were calculated on unseen data, providing a realistic estimate of model generalization ability.


- **Source:** Kaggle (dataset credited to *P. Malekian, 2023*).  
- **Files used (place in `data/`):**
  - `cardata.csv` (original)
  - `cardata_Train.csv` (training subset)
  - `cardata_Test.csv` (test subset)
- **Size:** 301 rows with numerical and categorical fields.

### Features (attributes)
- `Car Name`
- `Year`
- `Owner`
- `Present Price` *(in thousands of USD)*
- `Kms Driven`
- `Fuel Type` *(Petrol / Diesel / CNG)*
- `Seller Type` *(Dealer / Individual)*
- `Transmission` *(Manual / Automatic)*
- `Selling Price` *(target, in thousands of USD)*

> In WEKA-based preprocessing, `Car Name` and `Owner` were dropped as low-signal predictors for price.

## 3) Methods

Analyses were performed primarily in **WEKA**:

1. Import dataset into WEKA Explorer.
2. Remove `Car Name` and `Owner` from features.
3. Normalize attributes (WEKA filters) for algorithms that benefit from scale.
4. Train/test as follows:
   - **Linear Regression:** 10-fold cross-validation on the full dataset.
   - **KNN:** Multiple K values evaluated; final K chosen by lowest RMSE. Training on first 251 rows; testing on last 50 rows.
   - **MLP:** Default/selected hyperparameters in WEKA; evaluated with RMSE.

### Linear Regression Model (LR)
- **Correlation coefficient:** `0.9202`
- **RMSE:** `2.0142`
- **Learned equation (using normalized/coded variables):**

\[
\hat{Y} = 6.0475\,x + 40.2159\,x_1 - 3.5097\,x_2 + 1.8827\,x_3 + 1.1635\,x_4 + 1.4344\,x_5 - 3.8721
\]

Where:
- \(Y\): Selling Price  
- \(x\): Year  
- \(x_1\): Present Price  
- \(x_2\): Kms Driven  
- \(x_3\): Fuel Type (encoded)  
- \(x_4\): Seller Type (encoded)  
- \(x_5\): Transmission (encoded)

> For categorical variables, only the relevant dummy coefficient applies (others are zero).

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**K sweep (RMSE):**

| K | RMSE  |
|---|------:|
| 3 | 2.4100 |
| 5 | 2.4827 |
| 7 | 2.6395 |
| 10 | 2.7291 |
| 11 | 2.7308 |
| 12 | 2.7127 |
| 15 | 2.7741 |
| 17 | 2.8829 |
| 20 | 3.0209 |

- **Chosen K:** `3` (lowest RMSE in sweep)
- **Supplied test set (last 50 rows):** `RMSE = 0.6051`

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- **RMSE:** `1.4805`

---

## 4) Results & Conclusion

- **Best overall model:** **KNN (K=3)**, achieving **RMSE = 0.6051** on the held-out test set of 50 rows.
- Linear Regression achieved **RMSE = 2.0142** with a strong positive correlation (0.9202), but higher error than KNN.
- MLP achieved **RMSE = 1.4805**, better than LR but not as strong as KNN in this setup.

**Conclusion:** KNN provided the most accurate predictions for this dataset and split, likely due to local similarity patterns that LR and MLP didnâ€™t capture as effectively under the given preprocessing and hyperparameters.

---

## 5) Practical Recommendations

- **Mileage matters:** The negative coefficient for `Kms Driven` in LR indicates price generally **decreases** as mileage increases.
- **Newer year, higher resale:** Newer `Year` tends to **increase** predicted price.
- **Present price correlates:** Higher `Present Price` tends to align with a higher `Selling Price` (unsurprising but confirmed).
- Use KNN for near-term predictions on similar data; consider feature scaling and careful train/test partitioning.

## 6) Reproducing the Study (WEKA)

1. Open WEKA â†’ *Explorer* â†’ *Preprocess*.
2. Load `data/cardata.csv`.
3. Remove attributes: `Car Name`, `Owner`.
4. Apply normalization filter to numeric attributes.
5. **Linear Regression:** *Classify* â†’ choose *LinearRegression* â†’ *Use training set* or *Cross-validation (10 folds)* â†’ *Start*.
6. **KNN:** *IBk* classifier â†’ try K = 3, 5, 7, 10, ... â†’ *Supplied test set* with `cardata_Test.csv` (train on `cardata_Train.csv`).
7. **MLP:** *MultilayerPerceptron* â†’ run with chosen params â†’ record RMSE.

> Can also optionally mirror the analysis in Python (e.g., scikit-learn) using the same splits and encodings.
